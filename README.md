# progettoDDS
Detecting Causality in the Presence of Byzantine Processes

#TODO
#1 Consensus -> done (with flooding, usage of commander-lieutants algorithm suggested by Leslie Lamport)
#2 bc (for consensous) -> done (flooding)
#3 ack (priority) ==> send msg s.t. I'm Alive / nack
#4 pfd (to see) -> done
#5 agreement:  Every non-faulty replica receives every message. -> done (hopefully)
#6 FIFO
#7 LASKALSJ : This matrix is used to track and order events across different processes in such a system.
#8 RSM (replication set machine) ==> implied such module RSM.py (class with finite state + FIFO + agreememt)


###OPTIONAL: review graph init assigning of tcp ports for nodes connections since there might be some issues
