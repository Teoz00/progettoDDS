#TODO
#1 Consensous 
#2 bc (for consensous)
#3 ack (priority) ==> send msg s.t. I'm Alive / nack
#4 pfd (to see)
#5 agreement:  Every non-faulty replica receives every message.
#6 FIFO
#7 LASKALSJ : This matrix is used to track and order events across different processes in such a system.
#8 RSM (replication set machine) ==> implied such module RSM.py (class with finite state + FIFO + agreememt)
